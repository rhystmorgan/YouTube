## Learn Cardano Smart Contracts

This repo contains all of my example contracts from YouTube, written in Aiken and Lucid

To run any of this yourself you will need to install Aiken and Deno. 

> You can follow the getting started guide on [aiken-lang.org](https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions)

## Using This Repo

Just copy the appropriate `.ak` file into `validators` and run `aiken build` to compile it.

In each of the `.ts` files you will see a command to run 

eg:
```
// deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env lucidInit.ts
```
